# 🛍️ Final Project – Rozetka Staff Panel

This repository contains my final project for the **Front-End Pro** course at **Hillel IT School**.

## 📋 Project Description

This is a web-based admin panel created for internal use by employees of the **Rozetka** store. The application allows staff members to:

- ✅ View the list of available products

It is built with **React + Vite** and communicates with a custom backend via API.
